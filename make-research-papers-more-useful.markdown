When reviewing papers or trying to put the finishing touches on your own paper, it's useful to keep the following questions in mind:

1. Could the title be more precise about the contents of the paper?  What caveat/limitations are the authors leaving out?
2. Could the abstract be more precise about the contents of the paper? What caveat/limitations are the authors leaving out?
3. After reading the paper, what important thing did I learn (e.g., a technical result, or a limitation of the paper, etc.) that I wish I had known at the beginning?  What is the most precise version of the punchline that fits in a few sentences?  This should go in the abstract or introduction.
4. Are there any terms that are neither defined, referenced, nor have a Wikipedia page?  Then the authors need to define it, reference it, or write the Wikipedia page.
5. Do the authors describe their model/Hamiltonian extremely explicitly and clearly at the beginning?  If not, do they at least do it later in the paper and point the reader to it by giving an equation number?
6. What are the key differences between this paper and earlier work?  Can the paper be concisely described as "like Ref. \[N\], but with change X"?
7. Does the conclusion/summary do anything besides just repeat what's already been said in the introduction?  If so, does the conclusions/summary at least make use of precise terms/ideas that are defined in the body of the paper and therefore could not have been used in the introduction?
8. Who is the intended audience?  Do the contents of the paper make sense given that audience?  For instance, if the paper is about a niche technical result relying on the reader understanding many past papers in this particular small subfield, there's no point in writing a Nature-style introduction that is targeted at a very broad audience.
9. Is all notation defined explicitly?  Could the authors give multiple definitions (e.g., one English language and one mathematical) as a way to error correct their communication with the reader?
10. What ideas in the paper could use a figure that hasn't been made?
11. What can be done to make each figure understandable with the minimum possible reading of the rest of the paper?
12. What could be moved into an appendix?
13. What could the authors add to make it easier for the reader to only read part of the paper, e.g., can sections be made more stand-alone and better described in the introduction?
14. Which citations should include page or equation numbers to make it easier for the reader to find the precise thing the author is referring to?
15. When building on previous mathematical results, can the author include an explicit mapping from the previous notation and the current notation?
16. If anything is done with continuous variables, infinite dimensions, etc., is it possible to first do it with finite sets, countable sets, or finite dimensions?

Titles and abstract should be written to help the reader decide, as soon as possible, if they don't want to read the paper.  The literature is vast and our time to read it is limited, so readers want to be able to eliminate papers as quickly as possible.  Authors have bad incentives here to try to get as many eyeballs on the paper as possible, even if those readers would later regret spending the time reading the paper.
