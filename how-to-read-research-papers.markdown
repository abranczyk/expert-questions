Reading research papers can be super rewarding, but you need to be a bit more deliberate about the process to get the most out of it. Here are some things to keep in mind as you go:


1. **What is my purpose for reading this?** *Before* you begin reading, you need to know precisely why you’re reading so you’ll know what you should be looking for.
2. **What do I already know about this topic?** After glancing at the title, but still before you start reading, you should warm up by taking a couple of minutes to jot down quickly everything you know about the topic.
3. **What’s the big picture here?** Before you start reading the material closely, you skim through it to get an outline of the main points.
4. **What’s the author going to say next?** As you begin to read the material closely, you try to stay one step ahead of the author by anticipating what he or she will say next. 
5. **What are the “[expert questions](../)”?** Each subject asks a unique set of questions that you need to keep in mind as your read.
6. **What questions does this information raise for me?** As you read, you need to be aware of the other questions the material should be raising in your mind. 
7. **What information is important here?** As you’re reading, you need to decide what information is important enough to include in your notes. What’s important will depend on your purpose.
8. **How can I paraphrase and summarize this information?** As you take notes on the important information you are selecting, you should translate the author’s words into your own, using as few as you can.
9. **How can I organize this information?** Once you’ve finished taking notes, explore them to see how the information is organized and whether you can create any new groupings or links that make sense.
10. **How can I picture this information?** Again looking over your notes, you goal now is to translate as much of the information into symbols and pictures as possible. 
11. **What’s my hook for remembering this information?** Now that you’ve worked with the information and begun to understand it, you need a hook or gimmick to ensure that you’ll be able to remember what you need to know.
12. **How does this information fit in with what I already know?** As you look over your notes, you should be trying to see how the new information fits in with what you already know—not just about that topic, but about others as well.
