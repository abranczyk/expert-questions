# Welcome to Expert Questions

In science and technology, each subject asks a unique set of questions that you need to keep in mind as you read research in that field. Knowing what these questions are is a key part of getting the most out of reading research papers.

At [Expert Questions](https://abranczyk.github.io/expert-questions/), you will find a curated collection of expert questions in a variety of topics in science and technology. You can use these questions in Step 5 of the [guide to reading research papers](https://abranczyk.github.io/expert-questions/how-to-read-research-papers/).

If you would like to propose a new set of expert questions, please do so [here](https://github.com/abranczyk/expert-questions/issues/new?assignees=abranczyk&labels=question+submission&template=expert-question-submission.md&title=Expert+Questions+Submission). The topic can be as broad or as narrow as you like. 

*This site is a work in progress. As we add more questions, we will start to categorize them in an organic way.*
