When reading about modifications to quantum mechanics to address the measurement problem, keep the following questions in mind:

1. What experiment would be necessary to distinguish the new theory from traditional quantum mechanics?  Has it already been done?
2. Does the new theory still violate Bell inequalities?
3. Does the new theory violate unitarity? If so, what ensures that probabilities remain consistent?
4. Does the new theory violate linearity? If so, does it enable Everett phones?
5. Does the new theory change the Born rule? If so, are the probabilities consistent under appending non-interacting auxiliary systems?
6. How does the new theory compare to existing objective collapse models (e.g., GRW, CSL, etc.)?
7. Does the theory rely on a decomposition of the universe with preferred subsystems? Are these plausibly fundamental?
8. Is the theory Lorentz invariant?  If not, does a Lorentz invariant generalization seem feasible?
