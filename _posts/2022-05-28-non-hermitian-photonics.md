When reading about non-Hermitian photonics, keep the following questions in mind:

1. Is the studied system passive or does it have gain?
2. If it has gain, has the noise been carefully analyzed?
3. What is the bandwidth?
4. Does achieving the reported results require fine tuning of the design parameters or does it enjoy some degree of tolerance? 
5. Is it a linear system or does it involve nonlinearity? If so, have the nonlinear effects been considered in detail?
