When reading about single-photon detectors, keep the following questions in mind:

1. What is the detector efficiency? (higher is better)
2. What are the dark counts (lower is better)
3. What is the timing jitter (lower is better)
4. What is the deadtime? (low deadtime = high saturation rate)
5. What is the photon number resolution? (high is better)
6. Are they cryogenic? (non-cryogenic is better)
7. How much do they cost? (cheaper is better)
8. Are they integrated? (yes is better)
