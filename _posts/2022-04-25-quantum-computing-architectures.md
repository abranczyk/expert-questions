When reading about quantum computing architectures, keep the following questions in mind:

1. How many qubits does it have? 
2. What are the coherence times? (T1 and T2)
3. What kind of connectivity does it have? 
4. What are the 1- and 2-qubit gate fidelities? 
5. What depth of circuit can you do? 
6. What resources do the standard classical algorithms need to simulate your system? 
7. What’s the main drawback of the system?
   - The spec that’s the worst, the one you most need to improve? 
   - What prevents you from having a scalable quantum computer right now?
