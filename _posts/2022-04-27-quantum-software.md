When reading about quantum software, keep the following questions in mind:

1. Does this software enable using real quantum hardware or only a classical simulator?
2. In which part of the qauntum software stack does this software belong?
    - applications (development management)
    - algorithms (high level languages, libraries)
    - framework (circuit model & alternatives, optimizing compilers)
    - architecture (QPU kernel, quantum error correction, magic state factories, QRAM) 
    - control logic (pulse & timing calibration, optimal control, decoding)
    - simulator (verification & validation, performance)
3. What is the competitive landscape at this level of the software stack?
